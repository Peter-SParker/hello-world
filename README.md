# hello-world
My first GitHub repository. I'm probably gonna use this as a test area and as a common area. 

I am a self-educated web-developer, currently using this tutorial repository as a quick way to gain the knowledge needed to use GitHub. So far, this seems like an amazing service offering a lot in way of helping small or large developers create, and manage the projects they are working on.
